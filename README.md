# Python Basics

This repository contains small Python exercises that document my learning progress and help me build a solid foundation for data analysis. The notebooks focus on essential Python concepts that are commonly used in data analytics such as working with lists, loops, functions, dictionaries and simple data simulations. The goal is to develop practical skills step by step and apply them in small real world style examples.

## Contents
